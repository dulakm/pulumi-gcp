/**
 * Four different resources help you manage your IAM policy for a organization. Each of these resources serves a different use case:
 *
 * * `gcp.organizations.IamPolicy`: Authoritative. Sets the IAM policy for the organization and replaces any existing policy already attached.
 * * `gcp.organizations.IamBinding`: Authoritative for a given role. Updates the IAM policy to grant a role to a list of members. Other roles within the IAM policy for the organization are preserved.
 * * `gcp.organizations.IamMember`: Non-authoritative. Updates the IAM policy to grant a role to a new member. Other members for the role for the organization are preserved.
 * * `gcp.organizations.IamAuditConfig`: Authoritative for a given service. Updates the IAM policy to enable audit logging for the given service.
 *
 * > **Note:** `gcp.organizations.IamPolicy` **cannot** be used in conjunction with `gcp.organizations.IamBinding`, `gcp.organizations.IamMember`, or `gcp.organizations.IamAuditConfig` or they will fight over what your policy should be.
 *
 * > **Note:** `gcp.organizations.IamBinding` resources **can be** used in conjunction with `gcp.organizations.IamMember` resources **only if** they do not grant privilege to the same role.
 *
 * ## google\_organization\_iam\_policy
 *
 * !> **Warning:** New organizations have several default policies which will,
 *    without extreme caution, be **overwritten** by use of this resource.
 *    The safest alternative is to use multiple `gcp.organizations.IamBinding`
 *    resources. This resource makes it easy to remove your own access to
 *    an organization, which will require a call to Google Support to have
 *    fixed, and can take multiple days to resolve.
 *
 *    In general, this resource should only be used with organizations
 *    fully managed by this provider.I f you do use this resource,
 *    the best way to be sure that you are not making dangerous changes is to start
 *    by **importing** your existing policy, and examining the diff very closely.

 * ```typescript

 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * IAM member imports use space-delimited identifiers; the resource in question, the role, and the account.
 *
 * This member resource can be imported using the `org_id`, role, and member e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:organizations/iamMember:IamMember my_organization "your-orgid roles/viewer user:foo@example.com"
 * ```
 *
 *  IAM binding imports use space-delimited identifiers; the resource in question and the role.
 *
 * This binding resource can be imported using the `org_id` and role, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:organizations/iamMember:IamMember my_organization "your-org-id roles/viewer"
 * ```
 *
 *  IAM policy imports use the identifier of the resource in question.
 *
 * This policy resource can be imported using the `org_id`.
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:organizations/iamMember:IamMember my_organization your-org-id
 * ```
 *
 *  IAM audit config imports use the identifier of the resource in question and the service, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:organizations/iamMember:IamMember my_organization "your-organization-id foo.googleapis.com"
 * ```
 *
 *  -> **Custom Roles**If you're importing a IAM resource with a custom role, make sure to use the
 *
 * full name of the custom role, e.g. `organizations/{{org_id}}/roles/{{role_id}}`. -> **Conditional IAM Bindings**If you're importing a IAM binding with a condition block, make sure
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:organizations/iamMember:IamMember to include the title of condition, e.g. `google_organization_iam_binding.my_organization "your-org-id roles/{{role_id}} condition-title"`
 * ```
