/**
 * Three different resources help you manage your IAM policy for a Spanner instance. Each of these resources serves a different use case:
 *
 * * `gcp.spanner.InstanceIamPolicy`: Authoritative. Sets the IAM policy for the instance and replaces any existing policy already attached.
 *
 * > **Warning:** It's entirely possibly to lock yourself out of your instance using `gcp.spanner.InstanceIamPolicy`. Any permissions granted by default will be removed unless you include them in your config.
 *
 * * `gcp.spanner.InstanceIamBinding`: Authoritative for a given role. Updates the IAM policy to grant a role to a list of members. Other roles within the IAM policy for the instance are preserved.
 * * `gcp.spanner.InstanceIamMember`: Non-authoritative. Updates the IAM policy to grant a role to a new member. Other members for the role for the instance are preserved.
 *
 * > **Note:** `gcp.spanner.InstanceIamPolicy` **cannot** be used in conjunction with `gcp.spanner.InstanceIamBinding` and `gcp.spanner.InstanceIamMember` or they will fight over what your policy should be.
 *
 * > **Note:** `gcp.spanner.InstanceIamBinding` resources **can be** used in conjunction with `gcp.spanner.InstanceIamMember` resources **only if** they do not grant privilege to the same role.
 *
 * ## google\_spanner\_instance\_iam\_policy
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const admin = gcp.organizations.getIamPolicy({
 *     bindings: [{
 *         role: "roles/editor",
 *         members: ["user:jane@example.com"],
 *     }],
 * });
 * const instance = new gcp.spanner.InstanceIamPolicy("instance", {
 *     instance: "your-instance-name",
 *     policyData: admin.then(admin => admin.policyData),
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## google\_spanner\_instance\_iam\_binding
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const instance = new gcp.spanner.InstanceIamBinding("instance", {
 *     instance: "your-instance-name",
 *     members: ["user:jane@example.com"],
 *     role: "roles/spanner.databaseAdmin",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## google\_spanner\_instance\_iam\_member
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const instance = new gcp.spanner.InstanceIamMember("instance", {
 *     instance: "your-instance-name",
 *     member: "user:jane@example.com",
 *     role: "roles/spanner.databaseAdmin",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * For all import syntaxes, the "resource in question" can take any of the following forms* {{project}}/{{name}} * {{name}} (project is taken from provider project) IAM member imports use space-delimited identifiers; the resource in question, the role, and the account, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:spanner/instanceIamMember:InstanceIamMember instance "project-name/instance-name roles/viewer user:foo@example.com"
 * ```
 *
 *  IAM binding imports use space-delimited identifiers; the resource in question and the role, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:spanner/instanceIamMember:InstanceIamMember instance "project-name/instance-name roles/viewer"
 * ```
 *
 *  IAM policy imports use the identifier of the resource in question, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:spanner/instanceIamMember:InstanceIamMember instance project-name/instance-name
 * ```
 *
 *  -> **Custom Roles**If you're importing a IAM resource with a custom role, make sure to use the
 *
 * full name of the custom role, e.g. `[projects/my-project|organizations/my-org]/roles/my-custom-role`.
